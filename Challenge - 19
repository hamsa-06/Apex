Valid Subsequence
Given a method that takes two strings s1 and s2 return true if s1 is a subsequence of s2.
A valid subsequence means that string s1 can be formed from string s2 by deleting some characters, but maintaining the order.
public Boolean isSubSequence(String s1, String s2){
    Integer i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < s1.length() && j < s2.length()) {
        if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {
            i++; 
        }
        j++; 
    }
    return i == s1.length();
}
