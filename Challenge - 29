 Intersection

An intersection between two sets A and B is a set that contains all elements present in both A and B. For example, the intersection of sets {1, 5, 10} and {1, 3, 5} is {1, 5}, since 1 and 5 are the only two elements present in both sets.
Implement the method setIntersection that takes as input two sets of integers set1 and set2 and returns the intersection of the two sets. The method should not modify the original sets.

public Set<Integer> setIntersection(Set<Integer> set1, Set<Integer> set2) {
    Set<Integer> res = new Set<Integer>();
    for(Integer num:set1){
        if(set2.contains(num)){
            res.add(num);
        }
    } 
    return res;
}
